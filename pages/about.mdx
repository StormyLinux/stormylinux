## Overview

Stormy Linux, a Linux Distribution built as a tribute to the pet Russian white cat of the creator of the distro. Stormy was a brave, gentle and intelligent cat born with `full heterochromia`. Stormy had green and blue eyes, with the right eye being green and the left eye being blue. After the unexpected passing of Stormy, the creator decided to build a project as a tribute to Stormy, and a Linux distribution was the perfect choice.

## Why Linux?

The creator of Stormy Linux is a Linux user and has been using it long before the start of his journey in software engineering. Linux functioned as a daily driver and go-to solution for software engineering and system architecture. 

## Did you know?

"I've always had a fascination with animals, whether they were aquatic animals, vertebrates, mammals, reptiles, amphibians or invertebrates. After raising the pets I had, I developed an understanding of their nature, which helped me understand life from different perspectives. My greatest bond with a pet was with that of Stormy. Even through my darkest days, his mere presence was comforting enough to get me through some rough times." &mdash; WMouton

## Creator comment

> Since the start of my software engineering journey, Stormy has always been there, laying on my desk in front of my computer screen keeping me company as I was coding. I used to explain problems and solutions to him as he watched me and meowed at me like he understood what I was saying. 


## Colors

The colors used in Stormy Linux is inspired by Stormy's marbel-like green and blue eyes, pink nose and white hair.
