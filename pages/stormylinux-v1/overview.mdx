# v1.0 Status Bar

Let's take a look at the v1.0 status bar of Stormy Linux.

<br />

<Image src={stormylinuxbar} alt="SL Bar v1" />

<br />

## Stormy Linux v1.0 Status Bar

The status bar used by **Stormy Linux** the default bar of Qtile. All icons are being imported from the default collection of Qtile icons. Although, recently... **Stormy Linux** has been leveraging the "Qtile Extras" package, which includes extra modules and scripts that can be used to extend Qtile.

## The Menu

**Stormy Linux** uses rofi as its default menu, you can click the **Stormy Linux** logo at the far left corner in the status bar to access the rofi menu.

## Workspace Icons

The workspace icons aligned on the left side of the status bar after the Stormy Linux logo indicates what goes on which workspace, eg. `VSCode` goes on workspace 1, the `Vim` text editor is linked to `mod` + `F2` and the `Home` icon is where the welcome screen lives, and can be accessed using `mod` + `F1`. There are exactly `14` workspace icons for you to leverage. To know more about workspace icons  and how to access them, refer to the shortcut section that contains the [keybindings](/keybindings) you can use to switch workspaces.

## Layout Indicator

<br />

<br />

## D-Menu

To access the d-menu to spin up applications you want to use, it's as easy as using a specific [keybinding](/keybindings), by using `mod + r`, the d-menu will display next to the layout icon.

## Caps and Numlock Indicators

This indicator let's you know whether Caps Lock and Num Lock are on or off. 

<Image src={capsnum} alt="SL Caps Num v1" />

## Window Name

This section displays any current windows that you may have open on the selected workspace. The rectangle with the blue background is where open windows will be displayed on a selected workspace.

## Widgets

The widgets on the right side of the status bar after the window name indicate system processes. These widgets currently display system resource usages, these include `Network`, `CPU`, `RAM`, `Swap`, `Temperature`, `Volume` and `Date`

<br />

<br />

## Logout, Reboot and Shutdown

<br />
