## Flashing a USB

You can flash an image with **dd** on **Linux** using the below methods:

**Using dd**

```bash

```

**Example**

```bash
sudo dd if=~/StormyLinux/Downloads/Debian-12-Stable.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M ; echo $? status=progress
```

> Note: Balena Etcher is a great alternative to dd when flashing iso's to usb devices. Get balena etcher [here](https://etcher.balena.io). Windows users can leverage Rufus to flash usb devices. You can download rufus [here](https://rufus.ie/en)

After the iso has been flashed onto a USB, reboot your system and boot into the USB. Run the Arch or Manjaro installation.
