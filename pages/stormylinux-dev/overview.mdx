# Dev Edition Overview

A quick overview of Stormy Linux Dev Edition.

## Stormy Linux Developer Edition

Developer Edition is built with developers in mind, for those who take advantage of workspaces and leverage the power of multiple workspaces to create a productive environment. This edition comes with a wide range of functionalities and predefined keybindings that are simple and easy to understand and memorize.
