# Dev Edition Status Bar

Let's take a quick look at the Stormy Linux Developer Edition Status Bar. 

## Status Bar

The status bar used in **Stormy Linux Developer Edition** is the default Qtile status bar. Built in widgets are what is being leveraged in combination with the JetBrainsMono Nerd Font to display the icons. All system processes that are being used in the status bar are default widgets pulled from qtile.

> **Note**: A package called **Qtile Extras** is being used in a pop-up menu with the purposes of performing three tasks, **logout**, **reboot** and **shutdown**.

## The Menu

## Workspace Icons

### Active Workspaces

## Workspace Colors

**Active**

Active workspaces have a green highlighted icon when an application is active in that workspace, when you select and navigate to that workspace it will have an active "rose" like pink-ish foreground color and an active bottom border with a blue accent color.

**Inactive**

These are the workspaces with no activity, these are the icons that are hidden, and can be accessed by navigating to them.
